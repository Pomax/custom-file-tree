# How this library is versioned

As of `v2.0.2` this library _strictly_ adheres to [semver](https://semver.org)'s major.minor.patch versioning:

- patch version changes indicate bug fixes, internal-only changes, and docs updates.
- minor version changes indicate new functionality that does not break backward compatibility,
- major version changes indicate backward-incompatible external API changes, no matter how small.

Note that there may be gaps in the version history, which may happen if a release is pushed to npm but a problem is discovered fast enough to warrant an unpublish.

# Current Version
