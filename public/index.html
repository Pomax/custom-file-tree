        This page shows off a dummy &lt;file-tree&gt; with blanket "do
        everything" permissions. Note that there are no real files backing this
        tree, it's just the file tree <em>interface</em>, generating permission
        events that we just blanket-allow in order to show off what the
        interface lets your users do in terms of tree interaction.
      </p>

    <h2>The element:</h2>

    <file-tree show-top-level="true" remove-empty-dir="true"></file-tree>

    <p>
      You can click files, drag files and directories around, create, rename,
      and delete files and directories, and you can upload files or entire
      folders from your device (which, because this file tree isn't backed by
      anything, just means you see your filenames show up in the tree, there is
      no data associated with them on this page).
    </p>

    <h2>The HTML that made the above work:</h2>

    <p>
      It's an HTML element. The code is identical to other HTML elements, in
      that you just write:
    </p>

    <pre><code>&lt;file-tree&gt;&lt;/file-tree&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>Or generate a <code>file-tree</code> element on the JS side:</p>

    <pre><code>const tree = document.createElement(`file-tree`);
tree.setFiles([`a`, `list.of`, `file.paths`]);
document.body.appendchild(tree);</code></pre>

    <p>And that's all you need as far as the page code is concerned.</p>

    <p>In this case we've also specified two extra attributes:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;file-tree show-top-level="true" remove-empty-dir="true"&gt;&lt;/file-tree&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code>show-top-level</code> attribute shows the normally hidden
      <code>.</code> directory that everything lives under, and the
      <code>remove-empty-dir</code> attribute makes the file tree delete any
      directory that becomes empty when deleting the last entry it contains.
    </p>

    <h2>The JS that made the above work:</h2>

    <p>
      On th JS side, we get a reference to our file tree element, and then pass
      it a list of file paths, as an array of strings. Then, in order to make
      sure that you can see the tree "working", we set up event listeners for
      all permission events the file tree generates, granting them immediately.
    </p>

    <pre><code>// Add &lt;file-tree&gt; to our page and grab the element
import "../dist/file-tree.esm.js";
const fileTree = document.querySelector(`file-tree`);

// Set some files. Intentionally terribly sorted.
const demoList = [
  `dist/README.md`,
  `dist/file-tree.esm.js`,
  `dist/file-tree.esm.min.js`,
  `dist/old/README.old`,
  `dist/old/file-tree.esm.js`,

  `README.md`,
];

fileTree.setFiles(demoList);

// Listen for, and grant every, file tree event
const eventList = [
  // The main event your users care about
  `file:click`,
  // File events you care about
  `file:create`,
  `file:rename`,
  `file:move`,
  `file:delete`,
  // Directory events your users care about
  `dir:click`,
  `dir:toggle`,
  // Directory events you care about
  `dir:create`,
  `dir:rename`,
  `dir:move`,
  `dir:delete`,
];

eventList.forEach((type) =>
  fileTree.addEventListener(type, ({ detail }) => detail.grant())
);</code></pre>

    <h2>Is there a list of events?</h2>

    <p>
      Of course. Click the link to head on over to the project page for
      <a
        href="https://github.com/Pomax/custom-file-tree?tab=readme-ov-file#file-tree-events"
        >the list of events</a
      >
      and a description of what data they come with that you can use make
      permission decisions with.
    </p>

    <h2>Lift the hood!</h2>

    <p>
      If you "view-source" this page, you'll see there's nothing special going
      on in the HTML, and viewing the <a href="index.js">page JS</a> should show
      the same code as listed above.
    </p>

      For more information, head on over to its
      <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/custom-file-tree">project page</a> on
      GitHub, which has more detailed instructions on how to use this element,
      and how to work with th events it generates.
